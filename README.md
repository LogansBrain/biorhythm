This is my first attempt at a small RUST application.

This application expects a date argument YYYY-MM-DD and will plot (P)hysical/23 day, (E)motional/28 day, and (I)ntelletual/33 day bio-rhythm graphs for 30 days starting with the current date.

I struggled with 2 things. 

(1). Date types and conversions.
(2). Scope within the MATCH control flow expression.
